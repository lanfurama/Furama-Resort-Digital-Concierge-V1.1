# Only ignore files that are not needed for Vercel deployment
# Keep api/index.ts as the only serverless function entry point
# NOTE: Do NOT ignore api/config, api/controllers, api/models, api/routes
# because they are needed as imports. Instead, rename them to _config, _controllers, _models, _routes
# to prevent Vercel from detecting them as separate functions
