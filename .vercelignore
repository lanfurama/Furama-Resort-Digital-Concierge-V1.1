# Only ignore files that are not needed for Vercel deployment
# Keep api/index.ts as the only serverless function entry point
# Note: Vercel only creates functions for files with default export function handlers
# Files in subdirectories (config, controllers, models, routes) don't have function handlers
# so they won't be deployed as separate functions
